# FFT-Character-Recognition

As part of a university assignment, I have implemented a nearest-neighbour classifier to recognise the characters 'T','V','S','A' and 'B', based on properties of their fast fourier transforms. I then compared the results of the nearest neighbour classifier to a maximum likelihood classifier. 

A description and analysis of each of the classifiers can be found in SPS_CWKW_Report.pdf.
